/*
Read a five-letter word into the computer, then encode the word on a letter-by-letter basis by subtracting 30 
from the numerical value that is used to represent each letter. Thus if the ASCII character set is being used, 
the letter a (which is represented by the value 97)would become a C (represented by the value 67),etc. 
Write out the encoded version of the word. Test the program with the following words: white, roses, 
Japan, zebra.
