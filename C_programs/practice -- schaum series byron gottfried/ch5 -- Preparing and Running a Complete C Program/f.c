/*
Calculate the mass of air in an automobile tire, using the formula 
PV= 0.37m(T+ 460) 
where P = pressure, pounds per square inch (psi) 
V = volume, cubic feet 
m = mass of air, pounds 
T = temperature, degrees Fahrenheit 
The tire contains 2 cubic feet of air. Assume that the pressure is 32 psi at room temperature.
