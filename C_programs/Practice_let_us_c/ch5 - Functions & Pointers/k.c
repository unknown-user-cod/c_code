(k) Write a function to compute the greatest common divisor 
given by Euclid’s algorithm, exemplified for J = 1980, K =
1617 as follows: 
1980  / 1617 = 1      1980 – 1 * 1617 = 363 
1617 / 363 = 4        1617 – 4 * 363  = 165 
363 / 165 = 2          363 – 2 * 165  = 33 
5  / 33 = 5            165 – 5 * 33   = 000 
Thus, the greatest common divisor is 33
