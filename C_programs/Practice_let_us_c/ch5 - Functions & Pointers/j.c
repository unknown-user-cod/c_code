/*
(j) Write a function to compute the distance between two points 
and use it to develop another function that will compute the
area of the triangle whose vertices are A(x1, y1), B(x2, y2), 
and C(x3, y3). Use these functions to develop a function 
which returns a value 1 if the point (x, y) lines inside the 
triangle ABC, otherwise a value 0.
