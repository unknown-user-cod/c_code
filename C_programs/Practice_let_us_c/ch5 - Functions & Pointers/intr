(a) A 5-digit positive integer is entered through the keyboard, 
write a function to calculate sum of digits of the 5-digit 
number: 
(1) Without using recursion 
(2) Using recursion 


(b) A positive integer is entered through the keyboard, write a 
program to obtain the prime factors of the number. Modify the
function suitably to obtain the prime factors recursively.



(c) Write a recursive function to obtain the first 25 numbers of a 
Fibonacci sequence. In a Fibonacci sequence the sum of two 
successive terms gives the third term. Following are the first
few terms of the Fibonacci sequence: 
1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 89... 


(d) A positive integer is entered through the keyboard, write a 
function to find the binary equivalent of this number using
recursion. 



(e) Write a recursive function to obtain the running sum of first 
25 natural numbers. 




(f) Write a C function to evaluate the series 
sin(x) = x − (x3 / 3!) + (x5 / 5!) − (x7 / 7!) +.....
to five significant digits.



(g) Given three variables x, y, z write a function to circularly shift
their values to right. In other words if x = 5, y = 8, z = 10 after 
circular shift y = 5, z = 8, x =10 after circular shift y = 5, z = 8
and x = 10. Call the function with variables a, b, c to 
circularly shift values. 



(h) Write a function to find the binary equivalent of a given 
decimal integer and display it. 


(i) If the lengths of the sides of a triangle are denoted by a, b, 
and c, then area of triangle is given by
area = root of (S(S − a)(S − b)(S − c))
where, S = ( a + b + c ) / 2 


(j) Write a function to compute the distance between two points 
and use it to develop another function that will compute the
area of the triangle whose vertices are A(x1, y1), B(x2, y2), 
and C(x3, y3). Use these functions to develop a function 
which returns a value 1 if the point (x, y) lines inside the 
triangle ABC, otherwise a value 0. 


(k) Write a function to compute the greatest common divisor 
given by Euclid’s algorithm, exemplified for J = 1980, K =
1617 as follows: 
1980  / 1617 = 1      1980 – 1 * 1617 = 363 
1617 / 363 = 4        1617 – 4 * 363  = 165 
363 / 165 = 2          363 – 2 * 165  = 33 
5  / 33 = 5            165 – 5 * 33   = 000 
Thus, the greatest common divisor is 33
