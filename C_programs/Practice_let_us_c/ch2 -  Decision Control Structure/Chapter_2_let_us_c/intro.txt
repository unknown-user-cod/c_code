'''[I] Rewrite the following programs using conditional operators. 
(a) main( ) 
{ 
 int x, min, max ; 
 scanf ( "\n%d %d", &max, &x ) ; 
 if ( x > max ) 
 max = x ; 
 else 
 min = x ; 
} 
(b) main( ) 
{ 
 int code ; 
 scanf ( "%d", &code ) ; 
 if ( code > 1 ) 
 printf ( "\nJerusalem" ) ; 
 else 
 if ( code < 1 ) 
 printf ( "\nEddie" ) ; 
 else 
 printf ( "\nC Brain" ) ; 
} 

(c) main( ) 
{ 
 float sal ; 
 printf ("Enter the salary" ) ; 
 scanf ( "%f", &sal ) ; 
 if ( sal < 40000 && sal > 25000 ) 
 printf ( "Manager" ) ; 
 else 
 if ( sal < 25000 && sal > 15000 ) 
 printf ( "Accountant" ) ; 
 else 
 printf ( "Clerk" ) ; 
}
