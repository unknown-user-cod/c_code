A certain grade of steel is graded according to the following 
conditions: 
(i) Hardness must be greater than 50 
(ii) Carbon content must be less than 0.7 
(iii) Tensile strength must be greater than 5600 
The grades are as follows: 
Grade is 10 if all three conditions are met 
Grade is 9 if conditions (i) and (ii) are met 
Grade is 8 if conditions (ii) and (iii) are met 
Grade is 7 if conditions (i) and (iii) are met 
Grade is 6 if only one condition is met 
Grade is 5 if none of the conditions are met 
Write a program, which will require the user to give values of 
hardness, carbon content and tensile strength of the steel 
under consideration and output the grade of the steel. 
A library charges a fine for every book returned late. For first 
5 days the fine is 50 paise, for 6-10 days fine is one rupee and 
above 10 days fine is 5 rupees. If you return the book after 30 
days your membership will be cancelled. Write a program to 
accept the number of days the member is late to return the 
book and display the fine or the appropriate message.

If the three sides of a triangle are entered through the 
keyboard, write a program to check whether the triangle is 
valid or not. The triangle is valid if the sum of two sides is 
greater than the largest of the three sides. 
If the three sides of a triangle are entered through the 
keyboard, write a program to check whether the triangle is 
isosceles, equilateral, scalene or right angled triangle. 
In a company, worker efficiency is determined on the basis of 
the time required for a worker to complete a particular job. If 
the time taken by the worker is between 2 – 3 hours, then the 
worker is said to be highly efficient. If the time required by 
the worker is between 3 – 4 hours, then the worker is ordered 
to improve speed. If the time taken is between 4 – 5 hours, the 
worker is given training to improve his speed, and if the time 
taken by the worker is more than 5 hours, then the worker has 
to leave the company. If the time taken by the worker is input 
through the keyboard, find the efficiency of the worker. 
A university has the following rules for a student to qualify 
for a degree with A as the main subject and B as the 
subsidiary subject: 
(a) He should get 55 percent or more in A and 45 percent or

(b) If he gets than 55 percent in A he should get 55 percent or 
more in B. However, he should get at least 45 percent in 
A. 
(c) If he gets less than 45 percent in B and 65 percent or more 
in A he is allowed to reappear in an examination in B to 
qualify. 
(d) In all other cases he is declared to have failed. 
Write a program to receive marks in A and B and Output 
whether the student has passed, failed or is allowed to 
reappear in B.
